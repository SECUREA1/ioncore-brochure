            <h2>Product Overview</h2>
            <p>The InertiaCharge 50 is a portable, sustainable energy generator that utilizes magnetic inertia technology to convert kinetic energy into clean electrical power. Perfect for outdoor activities, off-grid use, or as an emergency backup, this innovative system delivers 50 W of continuous power and 200 Wh of energy storage in a compact and rugged package.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>InertiaCharge 50 uses a high-efficiency flywheel with magnetic bearings to store kinetic energy. When you activate the system, four copper-wound electromagnets accelerate the flywheel to high speeds, storing energy as rotational kinetic energy. Once at full speed, the system switches to generator mode, converting the rotational energy into stable electrical power.</p>
